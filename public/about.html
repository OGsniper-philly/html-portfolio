<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently in second year Computer Software Engineering at the University of Alberta. I have persistently challenged myself to a high degree of engineering excellence with a cumulative GPA of 3.9. I am proficient with both Python and C++, and utilize both languages regularly as an active software member of ARVP - Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project (UofA Club). I am part of the software team in charge of everything software related from Mission Planning, Control Systems, Computer Vision to Sonar Navigation. We are currently creating a new robot on ROS2 and I am in charge of the motion planning implementation using the ROS2 package Nav2. In Fall 2022, I led a 4 person hackathon team to achieve a 2nd place finish in the UofA Computer Engineering Hackathon HackEd Beta. We utilized the Arduino microcontroller to build a RC Car that is remotely controlled from my laptop. C++ was used in the embedded systems and Python was used to create the computer script to connect and remotely control the RC Car. In school, I have taken a broad range of engineering courses and pride myself in my problem solving skills. I am eager to learn more systems and technologies through work experience.</p>
